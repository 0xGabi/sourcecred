## SourceCred

The open-source community provides an enormous amount of value to the world. SourceCred aims to support that community by creating a sustainable model for funding open-source projects, and rewarding the contributors to those projects. We'll do that by enabling every open-source project to create its own digital token, called cred, which represents respect or "street cred" in the community. People will earn cred in a project by contributing to it.

For a high-level overview of how SourceCred works, check out [overview.md](overview.md).

For an in-depth discussion of SourceCred's design, check out [design.md](design.md) (under construction).

We aim to have design discussions on GitHub, so that people who contribute to the design will receive cred in SourceCred.
